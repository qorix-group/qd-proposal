==============================================
Proposal: Adoption of BDD-Based Testing with 
Cucumber and Selenium in Qorix Developer
==============================================

- To: Test Architect  
- From: Suresh Chamuah

--------------------
1. Objective
--------------------

This proposal recommends introducing a **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** testing framework using **Cucumber** integrated with **Selenium WebDriver** to enhance automated testing of Qorix Developer. The goal is to improve clarity, collaboration, maintainability, and coverage of test scenarios in alignment with user workflows and product requirements.

--------------------
2. Rationale
--------------------

Qorix Developer is an advanced tooling platform with complex workflows spanning configuration design, middleware integration, and code generation. Traditional test automation often results in:

- Test cases that are hard to map directly to user stories.
- Reduced readability for non-technical stakeholders.
- Difficulty maintaining tests as UI and workflows evolve.

Adopting **BDD** allows us to define expected behavior in **natural language (Gherkin)**, bridging the gap between product owners, developers, and testers.

--------------------
3. Proposed Approach
--------------------

3.1 Tool Stack
====================

- **Cucumber**: To write feature files in Gherkin syntax describing the user stories and acceptance criteria.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: To automate browser interactions and execute the steps defined in Gherkin scenarios.
- **JUnit** / **TestNG**: As the test runner.
- **Maven** / **Gradle**: For dependency management.
- **Allure Reporting** *(optional)*: For richer test reports.

3.2 Implementation Steps
==============================

1. **Framework Setup**
   - Configure Cucumber and Selenium dependencies.
   - Establish folder structure for features, step definitions, and page objects.
2. **Scenario Definition**
   - Collaborate with Product Owners to write **Gherkin feature files** capturing end-to-end workflows.
3. **Step Definition Development**
   - Implement Java-based step definitions linking Gherkin steps to Selenium commands.
4. **Test Execution**
   - Integrate into CI pipelines for automated execution on code changes.
5. **Reporting**
   - Generate HTML and dashboard reports summarizing pass/fail rates and traceability to requirements.
6. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - Establish version control and review processes for feature files and test scripts.

4. Benefits

   * - **Benefit**
     - **Description**
   * - Improved Collaboration
     - Feature files are readable by developers, testers, and product managers, promoting shared understanding.
   * - Traceability to Requirements
     - Gherkin scenarios align directly with acceptance criteria and user stories.
   * - Enhanced Test Coverage
     - Complex workflows can be easily expressed and validated end-to-end.
   * - Reusable Components
     - Step definitions and page objects are modular and reusable across scenarios.
   * - Better Reporting and Debugging
     - Test outcomes are easily understood and actionable.
   * - Scalability
     - New features can be covered by adding new scenarios without major rework.

--------------------
5. Example Scenario
--------------------

Below is an illustrative Gherkin feature:

.. code-block:: gherkin

   Feature: Project Creation in Qorix Developer

     Scenario: User creates a new Adaptive project
       Given the user is logged into Qorix Developer
       When the user clicks on "Create Project"
       And selects "Adaptive Platform"
       And enters the project name "MyAdaptiveProject"
       And clicks "Finish"
       Then the project "MyAdaptiveProject" should appear in the workspace

This example:

- Expresses intent clearly.
- Can be implemented in Selenium step definitions.
- Maps directly to product requirements.

--------------------
6. Next Steps
--------------------

1. **Framework Proof of Concept**
   - Develop a pilot suite covering critical workflows (e.g., project creation, import/export).
2. **Team Training**
   - Conduct sessions for QA and developers on Gherkin, Cucumber, and Selenium best practices.
3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Integrate automated execution into the build pipeline.
4. **Define Governance**
   - Establish ownership, review, and maintenance protocols.

--------------------
7. Conclusion
--------------------

Introducing **BDD testing with Cucumber and Selenium** in Qorix Developer will:

- Increase test quality and maintainability.
- Strengthen alignment between stakeholders.
- Accelerate delivery confidence for each release.
