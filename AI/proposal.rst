PROPOSAL

•	Project Title:
Graph-RAG Chatbot for AUTOSAR TPS Documentation

•	Executive Summary:

The purpose of this project is to develop a Chabot tailored to the AUTOSAR TPS PDF. By constructing a domain-specific knowledge graph and combining it with a vector-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, the system will deliver accurate, context-aware responses to engineering queries, while preserving the full technical fidelity of the original documentation.

•	Background and Context:

Current engineering teams spend excessive time searching through the AUTOSAR TPS PDF to locate configuration parameters, inter-module dependencies etc. This manual search process has reduced the productivity.

•	Objectives:

-	Build a knowledge graph that captures AUTOSAR entities (ECUs, software components, interfaces, parameters) and their relationships.  
-	Index unstructured text chunks via semantic embeddings for vector retrieval.  
-	Integrate graph-based and vector-based retrieval into a unified RAG framework.  
-	Enable continuous learning through user feedback and incremental graph updates.  
-	Define and execute comprehensive test cases to validate response accuracy and coverage.

•	Technical Approach:
Technical Programs and Libraries:
	Python  
	VS Code  
	PyTorch / TensorFlow  
	Hugging Face Transformers  
	LangChain  
	Neo4j (with vector index plugin)  
	FAISS (fallback vector store)  

•	Methodology:

Document Ingestion & Chunking
•	Parse PDF with Adobe PDF Extract API or PyMuPDF, including OCR for images.  
•	Segment into semantically coherent chunks (config blocks, diagrams, tables).  
Knowledge Graph Construction
•	Extract entities and relations via LLM-assisted NER and relation extraction.  
•	Ingest into Neo4j; index key attributes for graph traversal.  
Vector Index Creation
•	Generate embeddings for each text chunk using a pre-trained encoder (e.g., OpenAI or Huggingface open source embeddings).  
•	Store embeddings in FAISS or any other vector store.
Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline 
•	For each query, perform graph traversal to retrieve structured context.  
•	Perform vector similarity search on text chunks.  
•	Merge results and rerank based on relevance and confidence scores.  
Response Generation
•	Construct prompt template combining graph facts and text snippets.  
•	Generate answers with an open source LLM or any closed source LLM. 
Continuous Learning
•	Capture user feedback; update graph with new relations.  
•	Re-embed revised chunks and refresh vector index.  

•	User Interface & Integration:

Develop a web-based interface (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, React) that accepts text queries and displays:
-	Generated answer  
-	Links to original document sections  

•	Test Cases & Evaluation:

-	Define test suitable test cases to evaluate the chatbot.  
-	Measure accuracy (ground-truth comparison), latency, and user satisfaction.
