# Using JIRA as a Test Management Tool (Without Paid Plugins)

This guide explains how to configure JIRA for full test management without purchasing plugins such as Zephyr, Xray, or TestRail.  
The approach is fully ASPICE / ISO 26262 compliant.

## 1. Concept Overview

| Test Artifact   | JIRA Mapping      |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Test Plan       | Issue Type        |
| Test Case       | Issue Type        |
| Test Step       | Field or Sub-task |
| Test Execution  | Issue Type        |
| Test Result     | Custom Field      |
| Evidence        | Attachment        |
| Traceability    | Issue Links       |
| Defects         | Bug Issue Type    |

**Traceability path:**  
**Requirement → Test Case → Test Execution → Test Result → Defect (if failed)**

## 2. Required Custom Issue Types

| Issue Type      | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Test Plan       | Groups multiple executions for a release/sprint  |
| Test Case       | Contains test description, preconditions & steps |
| Test Execution  | Used to record execution results and evidence    |

---

## 3. Required Custom Fields

| Field Name      | Data Type  | Used For                               |
|-----------------|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Step Description | Text       | Describes the test step                |
| Expected Result  | Text       | What should happen after execution     |
| Actual Result    | Text       | Result captured during execution       |
| Status           | Dropdown   | Pass / Fail / Blocked / Not Executed   |
| Execution Date   | Date       | When the test was executed             |
| Build / Version  | Text       | Software version under test            |
| Tester           | User Picker| Name of person executing               |
| Evidence         | Attachment | Screenshots / logs / outputs           |

---

## 4. Workflow Recommendations

| Entity        | Suggested Workflow                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Test Plan    | Draft → In Progress → Completed                 |
| Test Case    | Draft → Review → Approved → Obsolete            |
| Test Execution | In Progress → Blocked → Passed / Failed        |

---

## 5. Required Issue Links for Traceability

| Link Type                     | Meaning                                  |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "tests" (Requirement → Test Case) | Requirement coverage                  |
| "executes" (Test Case → Test Execution) | Execution performed            |
| "is caused by" (Defect → Test Execution) | Defect due to failed test     |

---

## 6. Dashboard & Reports

Recommended JIRA gadgets:

- Filter Results (Test status by feature/sprint)
- Two-dimensional table (Execution status per Tester)
- Created vs Resolved (Defect trend)
- Heatmap (Failure by Module)

---

## 7. How to Scale

| Scenario                   | Strategy                           |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Large number of test cases | Use Components / Labels for grouping |
| Distributed testing teams | Use JIRA Permission Schemes          |
| Audit / ASPICE project     | Export report using Issue Navigator |

---

## 8. Export for Compliance

To export with evidence:

> **Issue Navigator → Columns = Steps + Result + Tester → Export → HTML / Excel / CSV + Attachments**

Also recommended: Attach `JIRA audit logs + dashboard screenshots` to safety work product.
